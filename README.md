# Hello-World-with-GPT-2
This is a very short program to get you started using GPT-2. It sometimes says "Hello, World!" but it often says other things instead.
It uses the HuggingFace Transformers library. 

Here is a sample of the output:

Hello

ace... I'm here

HELLO WORLD

Hello I am so and so

Hello

Hi! I'm chosen hero! I'm ready to travel the world and create a new world behind me

Hello, Human

Welcome. What a pretty planet

OK, let me drive around and see where I can be and get lost

I'm around

Hello
